# Individual site map and visitor journeys

Date: 2026-09-12. Owner requested a page-by-page breakdown before release. Tracking: bd_000-projects-dxtq.17.

## Logical hierarchy

Home answers what Intent Solutions does for the visitor. Projects is evidence discovery, not a checkout catalog. About establishes accountability. Contact is the primary request. Support serves existing users with agreement-specific boundaries. Field notes provide depth. Policies and the human site map are footer utilities.

Primary customer journey: Home -> inspect in-page evidence or Projects -> About if needed -> Contact -> inline success or recoverable error. Practitioner journey: Home secondary link or network Learn -> external Learn access requirements. Existing user: footer Support -> agreed support contact or the relevant repository. A newsletter is not presented until delivery and consent are verified.

## Legacy handling

Sixteen old service/learning URLs remain available as explicit, non-indexable handoffs. No forced redirect or removal of old URLs is required. Old sales copy remains recoverable in Git history. Do not index these as active offers. Support was rewritten because the prior copy implied included service levels; thank-you no longer asserts receipt or promises an email from a static URL. Projects no longer publishes unverified counts, retired infrastructure, or client claims. Existing About team changes were preserved.

## Individual article inventory

Article instances inherit the field-note route's reader purpose and return to the Field notes index. Their canonical attribution controls indexing. Source content is preserved, not rewritten as marketing. This inventory records the current local sources; newly synchronized notes inherit the same contract.

The upstream content rebase also preserved `/field-notes/the-cost-of-one-feature-in-a-sealed-repo/`, canonical to https://startaitools.com/posts/the-cost-of-one-feature-in-a-sealed-repo/ and excluded from this site's XML sitemap.

## Regression gates

The route contract lives in astro-site/src/data/site-map.mjs. audit-site-map.mjs checks complete source coverage, unique mappings, one H1, intended indexing, and every local link/anchor on static route pages. audit-indexability.mjs separately checks emitted XML URLs, canonical agreement, unique titles, and utility artifacts. Public /site-map/ exposes current company and related-property destinations, not obsolete offers. API endpoints and healthz are infrastructure, not marketing pages.
